```
What's your name? Alice
How old are you? 25
What's your favorite color? Blue
Hello Alice! You are 25 years old and your favorite color is Blue.
```

### Exercise 2: Number Analyzer
**Problem**: Create a program that analyzes a number and provides interesting facts about it.

**Requirements**:
- Ask for a number
- Tell if it's positive, negative, or zero
- Tell if it's even or odd
- Show its square and cube
- Show its absolute value

**Example Output**:
```
Enter a number: -7
Analysis of -7:
- It's a negative number
- It's an odd number
- Square: 49
- Cube: -343
- Absolute value: 7
```

### Exercise 3: Temperature Converter
**Problem**: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Requirements**:
- Ask for the temperature value
- Ask for the current unit (C or F)
- Convert to the other unit
- Display both temperatures
- Use the formulas: F = C √ó 9/5 + 32 and C = (F - 32) √ó 5/9

**Example Output**:
```
Enter temperature: 25
Enter unit (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit): C
25¬∞C = 77.0¬∞F
```

## üöÄ Intermediate Level (Lessons 4-5)

### Exercise 4: Grade Calculator
**Problem**: Create a program that calculates letter grades based on numerical scores.

**Requirements**:
- Ask for a test score (0-100)
- Assign letter grades: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (0-59)
- Give specific feedback for each grade
- Handle invalid scores gracefully

**Example Output**:
```
Enter test score: 87
Grade: B
Feedback: Good job! You're above average.
```

### Exercise 5: Password Strength Checker
**Problem**: Create a program that evaluates password strength.

**Requirements**:
- Ask for a password
- Check length (weak: <6, medium: 6-10, strong: >10)
- Check for common weak passwords
- Give specific improvement suggestions
- Use if/elif/else statements

**Example Output**:
```
Enter password: password123
Password strength: Medium
Suggestions:
- Consider using a longer password
- Avoid common words like 'password'
```

### Exercise 6: Shopping Discount Calculator
**Problem**: Create a program that calculates discounts based on purchase amounts.

**Requirements**:
- Ask for purchase amount
- Apply discounts: 5% for $0-50, 10% for $51-100, 15% for $101+
- Show original price, discount amount, and final price
- Format currency properly

**Example Output**:
```
Enter purchase amount: $75.00
Original price: $75.00
Discount: 10% ($7.50)
Final price: $67.50
```

## üéØ Advanced Level (Combining Multiple Concepts)

### Exercise 7: Number Guessing Game
**Problem**: Create a simple number guessing game.

**Requirements**:
- Generate a random number between 1-100
- Ask user to guess
- Give hints (higher/lower)
- Count attempts
- Ask if they want to play again
- Use loops and conditionals

**Example Output**:
```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100...
Your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Your guess: 37
Correct! You got it in 3 attempts!
```

### Exercise 8: Simple Quiz Game
**Problem**: Create a multiple-choice quiz game.

**Requirements**:
- Create 5 questions with multiple choice answers
- Track score
- Show correct answers
- Give final score and percentage
- Use lists and loops

**Example Output**:
```
Question 1: What is the capital of France?
A) London  B) Paris  C) Berlin  D) Madrid
Your answer: B
Correct!
Score: 1/1

Final Score: 4/5 (80%)
```

### Exercise 9: To-Do List Manager
**Problem**: Create a simple to-do list application.

**Requirements**:
